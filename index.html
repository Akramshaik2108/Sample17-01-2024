        <p style="text-align: justify;">techniques to an HRIS can help support the justification of the investment in the system.
Therefore, the firm should have some expected use for the information retrieved in the
            process</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned earlier, one use of human resource related information is to support
decisionmaking in the organization. The results obtained from data mining may be used
for a full range of decision-making steps. It can be used to provide information to support
a decision, or can be fully integrated into an end-user application (Feelders et al., 2000).
For example, a firm might be able to set up decision rules regarding employees based on
the results of data mining. It might be able to determine when an employee is eligible for
promotion or when a certain work group should be eligible for additional company
benefits.</p><br>
        <h2>Legal and Privacy Issues</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizational leaders must be aware of legislation concerning legal and privacy
issues when making decisions about using personal data collected from individuals in
organizations (Hubbard, Forcht, & Thomas, 1998). By their nature, systems that collect
employee information run the risk of invading the privacy of employees by allowing
access to the information to others within the organization. Although there is no explicit
constitutional right to privacy, certain amendments and federal laws have relevance to
this issue as they provide protection for employees from invasion of privacy and
defamation (Fisher, Schoenfeldt, & Shaw, 1999). Organizations can protect themselves
from these employee concerns by having solid business reasons for any data collection
            from employees.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also some potential legal issues if a firm uses inappropriate information
extracted from data mining to make employment-related decisions. Even if a manager has
an understanding of current laws, he or she could still face challenges as laws and
regulations constantly change (Ledvinka & Scarpello, 1992). An extreme example that
may violate equal opportunity laws is a decision to hire only females in a job classification
            because the data mining uncovered that females were consistently more successful.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One research study found that an employee’s ability to authorize disclosure of
personal information affected their perceptions of fairness and invasion of privacy
(Eddy, Stone, & Stone-Romero, 1999). Therefore, it is recommended that firms notify
employees upon hire that the information they provide may be used in data analyses.
Another recommendation is to establish a committee or review board to monitor any
activities relating to analysis of personal information (Osborn,1978). This committee can
review any proposed research and ensure compliance with any relevant employment or
            privacy laws.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted in the above study (Eddy <i>et al.</i>, 1999), often the employee’s reaction to
the use of his or her information is based upon personal perceptions. If there is a
perception that the company is analyzing the data to take negative actions against
employees, employees are more apt to object to the use. However, if the employer takes
the time to notify employees and obtain their permission—even if there may be no legal
consequences— the perception of negativity may be removed. Employee confidence is
            something that employers need to maintain.</p><br>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;">PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF DATA
MINING HR INFORMATION</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few organizations have started data mining their HRIS. MERLIN, a data
warehouse developed by the State of Mississippi, currently allows over 230 users to run
and access aggregate reports on position vacancies, salary patterns, and other HRrelated data (Roberts, 1999). In time, the State plans to use the data warehouse to help
find trends to identify where it has retention problems, attrition rates and reasons, and
average employee characteristics. <i>HR Vision,</i> an HR data warehouse product developed
by SAS Institute, has helped Deere & Co. find a way to quickly make predictions and run
reports from over 80,000 employee records (SAS Institute, 2001). For example, the
company identified patterns in employee-benefit selections. Through this process, it
was able to provide benefit options that were more attractive to workers, and , as a result,
            it was better able to manage the costs of the options provided.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions in Table 3 outline some areas of exploration for data mining an HRIS.
As an organization comes to the realization that it has a vast amount of information stored
that it isn’t using, it will probably be able to identify many other questions to be explored.
As mentioned earlier, it is important to formulate a question before jumping into data
mining. Here we will look at forming questions in two specific areas—identifying
effective sources of recruiting employees and estimating the value of training. These
examples are fairly simple, but provide the reader with an idea of the how data-mining
            techniques can be used to support human resource decisions.</p><br>
        <h2>Employee Recruitment Support</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizations are consistently looking for more effective recruiting methods to
minimize recruiting costs and also to find employees that are more likely to stay with the
organization for an extended period of time. High employee turnover can be very costly
to companies. The cost of turnover goes beyond the fee for running an advertisement
in a newspaper. Turnover costs include all replacement costs such as staff time in
interviewing, the cost of lost productivity while the position remains open, and the cost
of training the new employee (Cascio, 1991). Yet, very few employers evaluate the
            success of their recruiting sources.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many sources from which organizations fill open positions. An organization may place an advertisement in a newspaper or on the Internet, hold a job open
house, collect employee referrals, use a third-party recruiter, or many other options.
Recruiters may use a variety of approaches in very large companies without ever
communicating to each other the success (or lack of success) of a particular source. Data
mining offers a possible solution to this problem. If an organization tracks the recruitment
source of new hires, it can search for patternsin recruitment source relating to successful
employees. To do this, the organization must first identify the measure to identify
successful employees. An organization might, for example, define a successful employee
            as an employee who received a top performance appraisal rating.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least two different data-mining methods could be used for this question. First,
a regression model or Neural Network model might be applied. In this approach, a success
score would be assigned to employees in the data sample. Then the possible predictor variables would be decided. One or both of the above model types could be run on the
data to obtain a formula that predicts the success score of an employee with the given
predictor variable values. Secondly, a classification type of approach could be used. In
this modeling approach, two samples—one of high performers and one of low performers—are obtained. Then, a statistical group score is developed. The data for a new
            potential hire can then be processed to predict in which group he or she will be.</p><br>
        <h2>Employee Training Evaluation</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important step in the instructional design process is the evaluation of training.
Most training evaluation focuses on evaluating specific training programs and the
specific change that has or has not occurred as a result of that program (Sackett & Nelson,
1993). This type of evaluation is helpful in determining the content of future training
programs by understanding the components of specific training programs that were
effective or ineffective. This type of evaluation is essential to organizations, but some
            organizations may want to look at the value of training in a different context.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee training and development activities in an organization are of significant
strategic importance, and they are also very costly to organizations (Tannenbaum
&Woods, 1992). Considering the high cost of training in an organization, company
leaders may be interested in looking at training from the “big picture” perspective. If a
company can identify its overall training budget, it may want to know what kind of impact
this total figure is having on the company. One approach to identifying this effect would
be to look at the success of employees who have participated in company training
            programs. Are they progressing through the organization? Are they receiving promotions and moving up the career ladder?</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of information is not readily available to organizations. While they may
be able to evaluate the results of a specific training effort, it is often difficult to evaluate
training as a whole. Data mining might offer a solution to this evaluation question. Many
organizations store training-related data in their HRIS. Some of the data stored includes
the content of training programs and records of which courses an employee has taken
(Herren, 1989). By setting up a data-mining program to search for patterns of training
activities related to advancement in the organization, a company might uncover data to
            support further training investments.</p><br>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;">CONCLUSIONS</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All organizations collect data on employees to utilize in administrative tasks such
as payroll processing and benefit enrollment. The use of the data beyond administrative
purposes can provide the basis for a competitive advantage by allowing organizations
to strategically analyze one of their most important assets— their employees. In order
to use this data for strategic decision-making, organizations must be able to transform
the data they have collected into useful information. When dealing with large sets of
data, this transformation can be a challenge for organizations. Data mining provides an
attractive opportunity that has not been thoroughly explored for human resource
information systems. The application of data-mining techniques to human resource information systems requires organizational expertise and work to prepare the system for
mining. In particular, a datamart for HR is a useful first step. Further, organizations must
be aware of legal implications of decisionmaking based on personal employee information. With proper preparation and consideration, HR databases together with data
mining create an opportunity for organizations to develop their competitive advantage
            through using that information for strategic decisionmaking.</p><br>
